List of next step so I don't need to spend too much time getting context back
when I switch projects.

In rough order of priority:

- Update Nix setup.
- Bump Nixpkgs.
- Switch to OpenTofu.
- Deal with deprecation warning on bucket permissions.
- Use external instead of var to manage deployment.
- Write another blog. It's time.
