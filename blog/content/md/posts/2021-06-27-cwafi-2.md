{:title "Cheap interpreter, part 2: tree-walking"
 :layout :post
 :tags ["cheap interpreter"]}

[Last week][part1] I described the general structure of an interpreter, and
gave a cursory introduction to parsing. From this point on, I will simply
assume I am starting with a parse tree, and ignore how it was produced.

This series is based on [Neil Mitchell][ndm]'s talk, [Cheaply writing a fast
interpeter][cwafi]. The talk compares a number of approaches to writing an
interpreter and tries to find a good balance between complexity and interpreter
overhead.

The following topics, while important, are out of scope:

- Parsing. We're assuming we start with a parse tree.
- Producing assembly code: the definition of "cheap" that Neil uses in the talk
  is "maintainers are not required to know another language" (specifically
  assembly).
- Semantic optimizations (constant folding, algebraic transformations, etc.).
  The goal is to compare the interpretation overhead of various approaches, and
  semantic optimizations are considered orthogonal to that.
- JIT is not explicitly excluded in the talk, but it is completely absent. This
  is probably also a consequence of the "cheaply" goal.

## Code sample

Tha talk uses a specific code snippet as the running example across all
approaches. We'll do the same. Here is the snippet as given in the talk:

```rust
x = 100;
for (i = 1000; i != 0; i--) {
  x = x + 4 + x + 3;
  x = x + 2 + 4;
}
x
```

The talk presents all of its approaches in [Rust], but I don't know Rust so I
made my explorations in a mix of [Haskell] and [Clojure]. I think there are
interesting things to say about both, I'll present both in this series.

The parse trees are going to look superficially different, but they encode the
exact same structure. Because Haskell does have a language to describe such
structure, we'll start with that:

```haskell
data Op
  = Add
  | Sub
  | Mul
  | NotEq
  deriving (Show)

data Exp where
  Lit :: Int -> Exp
  Var :: Int -> Exp
  Set :: Int -> Exp -> Exp
  Bin :: Op -> Exp -> Exp -> Exp
  Do :: Exp -> Exp -> Exp
  While :: Exp -> Exp -> Exp
  Print :: Exp -> Exp
  deriving Show
```
