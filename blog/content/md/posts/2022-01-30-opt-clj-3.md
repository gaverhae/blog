[Last week], I presented three different ways to measure what's taking up time
in a Clojure code base. This week, I'll walk through how to apply those three
types of measurements on a concrete use-case: optimizing my [AoC day 12]
solution.

### Starting point

We know from [last week] that leaving the [tufte] performance log in the code
has only a small impact on performance, so for convenience we'll leave them in.
We start from the code we had last week:

```clojure
(ns t.core
  (:require [taoensso.tufte :as tufte :refer [p]]
            [criterium.core :as crit]
            [clojure.string :as string]
            [clojure.set :as set])
  (:gen-class))

(defn parse
  [lines]
  (->> lines
       (map #(string/split % #"-"))
       (mapcat (fn [[a b]] [{a #{b}} {b #{a}}]))
       (apply merge-with set/union {})))

(defn small?
  [^String s]
  (p :small? (= s (.toLowerCase s))))

(defn ends?
  [[path]]
  (p :ends? (= (last path) "end")))

(defn part2
  [input]
  (loop [num-paths 0
         paths [[["start"] #{"start"} false]]]
    (if (empty? paths)
      num-paths
      (let [paths (for [[path visited twice?] paths
                        next-step (p :next-step
                                     (get input (last path)))
                        :when (p :when
                                 (or (not (visited next-step))
                                     (and (not= "start" next-step)
                                          (not twice?))))]
                    [(p :conj-path (conj path next-step))
                     (p :visited
                        (if (small? next-step)
                          (conj visited next-step)
                          visited))
                     (p :twice-check
                        (or twice?
                            (boolean (visited next-step))))])]
        (recur (p :filter-path
                  (->> paths (filter ends?) count (+ num-paths)))
               (p :remove-ends
                  (->> paths (remove ends?))))))))

(defn bench
  [f]
  (->> (crit/benchmark (f) {}) :mean first))

(defn -main
  [& args]
  (tufte/add-basic-println-handler!
    {:format-pstats-opts {:columns [:total :mean :n-calls :p50 :clock]}})
  (let [input (-> (slurp "day12")
                  (string/split-lines)
                  parse)]
    (when (not= 119760 (part2 input))
      (println "Somethin went wrong.")
      (System/exit 1))
    (println (format "bench: %.3e" (bench #(part2 input))))
    (tufte/profile {} (dotimes [_ 5] (part2 input)))
    (Thread/sleep 3000)
    (println "Waiting for profiler...")
    (read-line)
    (part2 input)))
```

I've changed the `-main` function a bit, so that running it returns all the
data we may want to collect: it will first benchmark the solution, then give us
a [tufte] profile, and then let us run a [VisualVM] profile if we want.

It's also checking that we still get the expected answer. This is easy to
overlook, hen working on performance, but if _all_ you're measuring is
performance, you may end up changing the meaning of the code and not noticing
right away. In practice you should probably have a more extensice test suite
than this.

At this point, running it yields:

### Laziness v. performance?

The first piece of insight we got [last week] was that laziness seems to be
getting in the way: in our performance logs, it seems to put all of the time in
`:filter-path`, even though that form should be reasonably fast, and only a
small fraction of our total runtime.

Profiling through [VisualVM] is also made difficult to interpret as the call
stack at runtime does not seem to follow the shape of the code.

So is laziness bad? Let's talk about it in slightly more general terms.

Laziness defers computation. Exactly how that is done depends on the underlying
data structures, but generally speaking the approach is to wrap the underlying
sequence in a pair of, on the one hand, the first element, and, on the other
hand, a function that can be called to get the next pair.

From a performance perspective, this wrapping has a cost, although usually a
smaller one that I would expect (the JVM is very good with small, short-lived
objects).

From a measurement perspective, it's definitely getting in the way, as we've
seen in this example.

So is laziness bad for performance? Well, it depends. One thing laziness allows
us to do is choose whether or not we get the next element. Any time you have a
situation where you stop after finding `n` elements and you can get there
without processing the entire source sequence, it's likely that laziness is
improving your performance. But that's not the case here. Here, we know that,
on each iteration, we want to process our entire `paths`. Since we're not
getting any benefit from laziness under those circumstances, let's get rid of
it.

The simplest way to achieve that is to wrap every lazy sequence creation in a
`doall` call. That function takes a lazy sequence and forces it, then returns
it. This means that, from a performance perspective, we should not expect any
improvement (we're still going through the exact same wrap-unwrap process), but
we should be able to get better measurements.

All of our laziness is in the `part2` function, so here is the updated version,
where we just added three `doall` calls. The rest of the code is unchanged.

```clojure
(defn part2
  [input]
  (loop [num-paths 0
         paths [[["start"] #{"start"} false]]]
    (if (empty? paths)
      num-paths
      (let [paths (doall (for [[path visited twice?] paths
                               next-step (p :next-step
                                            (get input (last path)))
                               :when (p :when
                                        (or (not (visited next-step))
                                            (and (not= "start" next-step)
                                                 (not twice?))))]
                           [(p :conj-path (conj path next-step))
                            (p :visited
                               (if (small? next-step)
                                 (conj visited next-step)
                                 visited))
                            (p :twice-check
                               (or twice?
                                   (boolean (visited next-step))))]))]
        (recur (p :filter-path
                  (->> paths (filter ends?) doall count (+ num-paths)))
               (p :remove-ends
                  (->> paths (remove ends?) doall)))))))
```

Hopefully, we should now spend little time in `:filter-path`, and, when
profiling with [VisualVM], similarly little time in `count`.

Here's the output:

```

We seem to have a little bit of an overhead for the `doall` calls we added
(which is somewhat expected), but more importantly we're no longer spending all
our time in `:filter-path`. The form we spend the most time in is `:ends?`,
closely followed by `:filter-path`. But remember that `:filter-path` contains a
call (or many) to `ends?`, so we really should be focusing on `:ends?` first.

### Data structures and abstractions

If you're familiar enough with the Clojure core library and its performance
characteristics, the problem with `:ends?` as defined may be immediately
apparent to you; if you're not, maybe the [VisualVM] output can help. Here is
the relevant section:

![VisualVM showing `last` is slow](/img/2022/blog/visualvm_last.png)

So most of the time spent in `ends?` is spent on `last`; `=`
(`Clojute.lang.Util.equiv`) seems pretty negligible in comparison. If you dig
into the details of `last`, you'll see that it is transforming its vector
argument into a `seq`, then traversing it one element at a time.

This is because `last` is a function that acts on the `seq` abstraction. But in
this case, we _know_ we're always calling `ends?` with a vector, and vectors
have near-constant-time indexed access, as well as constant-time `count`. So we
could instead do something like:

```clojure
(defn ends?
  [[path]]
  (p :ends?
    (let [c (count path)
          e (get path (dec c))]
      (= e "end"))))
```

While that would work, there's already a function in the standard library to do
exactly that: `peek`. Unlike `last`, which only works on sequences and
_converts_ its argument to a seq before processing it, `peek` is a polymorphic
function that acts differently based on the type of its argument. On a seq, it
returns the first element; on a vector, it returns the last element; on a
queue, it returns the head of the queue.

So let's go with that instead:

```clojure
(defn ends?
  [[path]]
  (p :ends? (= (peek path) "end")))
```

Running the code again, we get:

```plaintext

```

This is definitely an good improvement (~1.2s to ~0.84s), but let's not be too
short-sighted here.  Taking a step back, in order to be confident we can make
this change, we had to trace through all the calls to `ends?` and check where
the argument comes from.  In doing that, we should have noticed that:

1. The argument to `ends?` is always created from `["start"]`, by successive
   calls to `(conj path next-step)`.
2. `path` is _only_ ever used by being passed to `ends?` or to `last` (in
   `:next-step`).

The first observation here is what allows us to change `last` to `peek` (which,
incidentally, we could also do in `:next-step`). Now, if the only thing we ever
do with that vector is get its last element, we'll get it faster if we use a
vector-appropriate function, but we'll get it even faster if we don't have a
vector at all: clearly all we care about is our current position, not the path
that got us there. (More accurately, what we care about from the path is
already covered by `visited` and `twice?`.)

Keeping only the current position requires changes to both `ends?` and `part2`.
Here are the new versions. The rest of the code is unchanged.

```clojure
(defn ends?
  [[pos]]
  (p :ends? (= pos "end")))

(defn part2
  [input]
  (loop [num-paths 0
         paths [["start" #{"start"} false]]]
    (if (empty? paths)
      num-paths
      (let [paths (doall (for [[pos visited twice?] paths
                               next-step (p :next-step
                                            (get input pos))
                               :when (p :when
                                        (or (not (visited next-step))
                                            (and (not= "start" next-step)
                                                 (not twice?))))]
                           [next-step
                            (p :visited
                               (if (small? next-step)
                                 (conj visited next-step)
                                 visited))
                            (p :twice-check
                               (or twice?
                                   (boolean (visited next-step))))]))]
        (recur (p :filter-path
                  (->> paths (filter ends?) doall count (+ num-paths)))
               (p :remove-ends
                  (->> paths (remove ends?) doall)))))))
```

I don't expect a big performance difference here, because vector access is
quite fast and at this point `:ends?` is not a big part of our runtime anymore,
but this is a nice code simplification. Still, here is the new output:

Well, I must say that surprised me. I did not expect that much of an
improvement from removing those vectors.

### When your instrumentation gets in the way

We've now reached a slightly awkward situation for [tufte], as, per its own
report, it is now taking the majority of our time. As I mentioned [last week],
it may not be a great idea to have [tufte] `p` calls in the middle of a tight
loop, which definitely does seem to be what we're doing here given the number
of calls to `:when`, `:ends?`, etc.

So let's remove all of those and instead consolidate our performance logs on
bigger items:

```clojure
(defn small?
  [^String s]
  (= s (.toLowerCase s)))

(defn ends?
  [[pos]]
  (= pos "end"))

(defn part2
  [input]
  (loop [num-paths 0
         paths [["start" #{"start"} false]]]
    (if (empty? paths)
      num-paths
      (let [paths (p :paths
                     (doall (for [[pos visited twice?] paths
                                  next-step (get input pos)
                                  :when (or (not (visited next-step))
                                            (and (not= "start" next-step)
                                                 (not twice?)))]
                              [next-step
                               (if (small? next-step)
                                 (conj visited next-step)
                                 visited)
                               (or twice?
                                   (boolean (visited next-step)))])))]
        (recur (p :filter-path
                  (->> paths (filter ends?) doall count (+ num-paths)))
               (p :remove-ends
                  (->> paths (remove ends?) doall)))))))
```

This will give us less specific insights, but hopefully will also no longer get
in the way as much. And we can still use [VisualVM] for more fine-grained
insights if and when that's necessary. As a bonus, the call stack in [VisualVM]
will also be a bit easier to read without the [tufte] calls.

The new result is obviously shorter:

And comes with a small additional speed bump.

### Double duty

Usually we would now focus on `:paths` as that's the top-level entry. But it's
also a bit unclear what's going on there, as we were previously getting
performance logs for pretty much each operation in it and they added to a lot
less than 71% of runtime.

Let's ignore that for a minute, though, and take a look at the two other
entries.  One important point to note about them is that _they are doing the
same thing_: they both walk down the `paths` sequence and call `ends?` on each
element. We know from previous measurements of `:ends?` that the function call
itself is not taking much time, but still, we're traversing twice.

We could traverse that sequence only once by using the core function
`group-by`. It's a fairly simple change:

```clojure
(defn part2
  [input]
  (loop [num-paths 0
         paths [["start" #{"start"} false]]]
    (if (empty? paths)
      num-paths
      (let [paths (p :paths
                     (doall (for [[pos visited twice?] paths
                                  next-step (get input pos)
                                  :when (or (not (visited next-step))
                                            (and (not= "start" next-step)
                                                 (not twice?)))]
                              [next-step
                               (if (small? next-step)
                                 (conj visited next-step)
                                 visited)
                               (or twice?
                                   (boolean (visited next-step)))])))
            {ended true ongoing false} (p :group-by
                                          (group-by ends? paths))]
        (recur (p :filter-path (->> ended count (+ num-paths)))
               (p :remove-ends ongoing))))))
```

This gives us another small boost:

### `for`

We're spending about 20% of our time traversing a sequence we just created. We
could, instead, categorize each new path as we discover it. This would require
us to break the `for` macro call into less opaque function calls, and introduce
a nested loop.

`for` is an expressive macro, and it's really nice to use in many cases. But
it's just not the best at performance.

Let's first get rid of the `for` call:

```clojure
(defn part2
  [input]
  (loop [num-paths 0
         paths [["start" #{"start"} false]]]
    (if (empty? paths)
      num-paths
      (let [paths (p :paths
                     (->> paths
                          (mapcat
                            (fn [[pos visited twice?]]
                              (->> (get input pos)
                                   (filter (fn [next-step]
                                             (or (not (visited next-step))
                                                 (and (not= "start" next-step)
                                                      (not twice?)))))
                                   (map (fn [next-step]
                                          [next-step
                                           (if (small? next-step)
                                             (conj visited next-step)
                                             visited)
                                           (or twice?
                                               (boolean (visited next-step)))])))))
                          doall))
            {ended true ongoing false} (p :group-by
                                          (group-by ends? paths))]
        (recur (p :filter-path (->> ended count (+ num-paths)))
               (p :remove-ends ongoing))))))
```

This yields:

```plaintext

```

Which is slightly slower but has a similar breakdown. Now, let's turn that into
a loop rather than first building a sequence and then traversing it:

```clojure
(defn part2
  [input]
  (loop [num-paths 0
         paths [["start" #{"start"} false]]
         next-steps ()
         visited #{}
         twice? false]
    (cond (and (empty? paths) (empty? next-steps))
          num-paths
          (empty? next-steps)
          (let [[pos visited twice?] (first paths)]
            (recur num-paths (rest paths) (get input pos) visited twice?))
          (= (first next-steps) "end")
          (recur (inc num-paths) paths (rest next-steps) visited twice?)
          :else
          (let [next-step (first next-steps)]
            (if (p :ongoing?
                   (or (not (visited next-step))
                       (and (not= "start" next-step)
                            (not twice?))))
              (recur num-paths
                     (conj paths (p :build-path
                                    [next-step
                                     (if (small? next-step)
                                       (conj visited next-step)
                                       visited)
                                     (or twice?
                                         (boolean (visited next-step)))]))
                     (rest next-steps)
                     visited
                     twice?)
              (recur num-paths paths (rest next-steps) visited twice?))))))
```

This is a pretty big change. This is where it's important to have at least some
amount of tests. There's also some guesswork as to where to place the `p` tags
and how they will relate to what we were measuring before.

Did we gain anything?

```

We've just about doubled our speed. I think we've also reached the limits of
what [tufte] can do for us here, as `recur` calls cannot be tagged and every
iteration is now basically our tight loop.

So let's just remove all of [tufte] and rely on [VisualVM] from now on. This
yields a negligible improvement:

```plaintext
bench: 3.348e-01
```

### Hitting a wall (for now)

Running that code under [VisualVM], though, isn't all that helpful. Here's what
we get:

![VisualVM showing `first` taking up most of the time](/img/2022/blog/visualvm_first.png)

We're spending most of our time in `first`, `rest`, `empty?` and the set
operation on `visited`. There is no immediately obvious way to make those
faster, as they are part of the core Clojure library. There's also no obvious
way to _not_ call them: we do need to iterate through these collections, and
check whether we've already visited a node.

So that's it for today. That's as far as we can go with just our measurements
knowledge from [last week]. Next, I'll write about a few other optimization
techniques, then we'll come back to this code and, by applying those, make it
four times faster.
