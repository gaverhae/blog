{:title "Cheap interpreter, part 4: stack machines"
 :layout :post
 :tags ["cheap interpreter"]}

[Last week][part 3], I showed how to use host-language first-class functions as
a way to improve the efficiency of an interpreter. The code changes were pretty
small and local, which is good, but the performance benefits were not huge. In
this post, we're going to explore a completely different approach: we're first
going to design a stack machine, then write a compiler from our toy language to
stack machine instructions, and finally write an interpreter for the stack
machine language.

## What is a stack machine?

A stack machine is one where the state is represented as a stack. Other types
of "machines" in this sense include [Turing machines][turing], where the state
is not structured, and register machines, where the state is split among a
number of individually-referenceable slots.

What does it mean for the state to be represented as a stack? It means that the
core operations the machine supports will take one of the following forms:

- `push` a literal on the top of the stack.
- Read the value at the top of the stack and remove it (`pop`).
- Combinations of the above: `pop` a number of values from the stack, do some
  computation with them, and `push` the result back on the stack.

If we compare that to our [toy language definition][part 2], this gives us
direct equivalents to `Lit` and `Bin`, but it's not clear how to represent the
other operations. For reference, here is the source language:

```haskell
data Exp
 = Lit Int
 | Var Int
 | Set Int Exp
 | Bin Op Exp Exp
 | Do Exp Exp
 | While Exp Exp
  deriving Show
```

Let us first consider the issue of variables, because [Neil][ndm] actually
explains how to handle that in [his talk][cwafi]: if we assume we can also
access the bottom of the stack, we can just read variable values from there.
This suggests two more operations: `get` and `set`, which operate on indices
based off the bottom of the stack.

This leaves us with having to choose representations for `Do` and `While`. We
_could_ mirror the `Exp` structure, but if I'm going to write a compiler, I
want to take the opportunity to drop the level of abstraction, because that's
where the potential for optimization comes from. With that in mind, here is the
representation I chose:

```haskell
data StackOp
  = StackPush Int
  | StackSet Int
  | StackGet Int
  | StackBin Op
  | StackJump Int
  | StackJumpIfZero Int
  | StackEnd
  deriving (Show)

compile_stack :: Exp -> [StackOp]
```

Of note:

- The compiler is returning a list of `StackOp`: I have explicitly chosen a
  "flat" list structure over the tree structure we had in the parse tree. There
  will be no explicit equivalent to the `Do` expression.
- There is no `pop` operation, because we never `pop` in a vacuum: `pop`ping
  the stack will be done as part of the `Bin` operation.
- I chose to represent looping using a combination of conditional and
  unconditional jumps. This should be good enough to represent any
  surface-language loops, should the language grow variations like `do ... while`
  or `for`. A smart compiler could event convert tail-recursive functions to a
  loop using those primitives, if we had functions in the surface language.
- I chose to put an explicit `End` case, because that means the execution code
  does not need to constantly check if it has reached the end of the list.
  Because of the jump-based looping logic, we're not going to just traverse the
  list of instructions once, but instead we're going to jump around based on
  indices, and comparing indices to length on each iteration is a bit cumbersome.
