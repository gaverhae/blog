# Reading notes

This repo is where I keep my notes on books I read; mostly programming
exercises from programming books. It is unlikely that there will be anything of
interest for you here, but you're welcome to look either way. (Note: I
recommend doing the exercises yourself rather than look at my solutions.)

This also includes random exercises and code "challenges" I want to keep for
later.
