# Chapter 1

1. Give another possible calculation for the result of double (double 2).
double (double 2) = double 2 + double 2
                  = 2 + 2    + double 2
                  = 2 + 2    + 2 + 2
                  = 2 + 4 + 2
                  = 2 + 6
                  = 8

2. Show that sum [x] = x for any number x.

sum [x] = x + sum []
        = x + 0
        = x

3. Define a function product that produces the product of a list of numbers,
   and show using your definition that product [ 2, 3, 4 ] = 24.

product [] = 1
product (x:xs) = x * product xs

product [2, 3, 4] = 2 * product [3, 4]
                  = 2 * 3 * product [4]
                  = 2 * 3 * 4 * product []
                  = 2 * 3 * 4 * 1
                  = 2 * 3 * 4
                  = 2 * 12
                  = 24

4. How should the definition of the function qsort be modified so that it
   produces a reverse sorted version of a list?

rqsort [] = []
rqsort (x:xs) = rqsort larger ++ [x] ++ rqsort smaller
                where smaller = [a | a <- xs, a <= x]
                      larger = [b | b <- xs, b > x]

5. What would be the effect of replacing â‰¤ by < in the definition of qsort?
   Hint: consider the example qsort [ 2, 2, 3, 1, 1 ].

Same as `sort | uniq` instead of just `sort`, i.e. the resulting list is sorted
and has no duplicates.
