# Abbreviation

This is the [HackerRank Abbreviation] problem. I have a solution in Haskell and
two solutions in Clojure. The first one (`abbr`) is a direct translation of the
Haskell solution, while the second one  (`fast-abbr`) is optimized for speed
(about 4 times faster on the slowest HackerRank test case), at the price of...
well, it's pretty much undecipherable.
